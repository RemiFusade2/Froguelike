  description:
  - In the whimsical world of insects, weak flies are often the butt of all jokes.
    These winged critters are the bottom of the food chain and are seen as a "fly
    in the ointment" by the other bugs. While they may seem like easy prey for predators,
    they do have a few tricks up their sleeves.
  - Weak flies are known for their erratic movements, often buzzing around like they're
    "drunk as a skunk." This makes them difficult to catch for some predators, who
    may underestimate their speed and agility. However, for the main character of
    our story - a frog - they're a piece of cake. With one swift jump, the frog can
    easily gobble up these tiny pests.
  - Despite their reputation as "weak," weak flies do have a unique ability that
    sets them apart from other insects. When threatened, they can emit a noxious
    odor that can make even the bravest predator turn tail and run. This foul smell
    has earned them the nickname "stink bugs" among some of the other bugs in the
    game. While it may not save them from the frog, it can be a useful defense mechanism
    against other predators.
  - In this wacky world, weak flies play an important role in the ecosystem. They
    may be easy prey for the frog, but their constant buzzing provides a source of
    entertainment for the other insects. Plus, as the saying goes, "one man's trash
    is another man's treasure" - in this case, the weak flies are the frog's treasure
    trove of food!
