  description:
  - In our buzzing tale, the big fly is the heavyweight champion of the insect world.
    This oversized pest is a force to be reckoned with, with wings that flap like
    thunder and a stinger that packs a punch. Other bugs tremble in fear at the sight
    of the big fly, knowing that a run-in with this giant could mean certain doom.
  - Despite its intimidating size, the big fly is not invincible. Its large wings
    can make it clumsy and slow, making it an easy target for predators like our
    hero frog. And while its stinger may look dangerous, it's often more of a nuisance
    than a real threat. After a fight with the frog, the big fly would serve as a
    tasty meal - a reward for the frog's bravery in taking down such a formidable
    foe.
  - One of the big fly's defining characteristics is its appetite. This oversized
    pest can eat its weight in food every day, and has been known to raid picnics
    and garbage cans for scraps. It's no wonder the other bugs call it the "hungry
    giant." But for the frog, the big fly's voracious appetite is just another reason
    to take it down - after all, it's hard to be the top predator when you're constantly
    competing with a giant fly for food!
