  description:
  - Hold on tight to your frog hats, because the strong fly is here to shake things
    up in our buzzing adventure! This powerhouse of an insect is the ultimate challenge
    for our hero frog, with muscles in its wings that allow it to fly with incredible
    speed and agility. It takes a truly fearless frog to take on this mighty foe.
  - The strong fly is not just a force to be reckoned with in the air - it's also
    got a powerful stinger that can pack a punch. But don't let that intimidate you,
    because the frog has a few tricks up its sleeve too. With lightning-fast reflexes
    and a powerful jump, our hero can take down even the strongest of flies. And
    after a ferocious fight, the strong fly would serve as a well-deserved meal for
    the victorious frog.
  - One interesting thing about the strong fly is its diet. Unlike other flies, which
    feed on rotting food and other unpleasant things, the strong fly prefers to dine
    on the nectar of flowers. This gives it a distinctive sweet scent that can be
    a bit misleading - after all, you wouldn't expect something so pretty to be such
    a tough opponent! But the frog knows better than to be fooled by appearances,
    and is always ready to take on whatever challenges come its way.
  - So get ready to buzz into action, because the strong fly is ready for a fight!
    With its formidable strength and lightning-fast reflexes, it's sure to keep the
    frog on its toes. But with determination and a little bit of luck, our hero is
    sure to come out on top - and enjoy a delicious meal of strong fly sushi to celebrate.
