  description:
  - Welcome to the buzzing world of standard flies - the pesky pests that are a constant
    source of annoyance for the other bugs. These winged insects may seem harmless,
    but they can be quite the nuisance. They buzz around erratically, darting back
    and forth like they're "going fly fishing."
  - Standard flies are the epitome of "easy come, easy go." They're a snack for predators
    such as frogs, who can gobble them up with ease. But these little insects are
    a surprisingly important part of the ecosystem. Their buzzing can help pollinate
    flowers and other plants, and they also serve as a food source for other creatures
    in the game.
  - While standard flies may not be the most formidable foes, they do have one trick
    up their sleeve - or rather, in their wings. They can fly at incredible speeds,
    making them difficult to catch for some predators. Their ability to fly and maneuver
    quickly has earned them the nickname "little rockets" among some of the other
    bugs. But for the frog, they're just another easy meal in the never-ending cycle
    of life in the game.
