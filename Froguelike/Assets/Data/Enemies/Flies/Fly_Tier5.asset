  description:
  - In this twisted tale, the alpha fly is no ordinary insect. This is a genetically
    modified monstrosity, created in a lab by a mad scientist who was determined
    to make the ultimate weapon in the war against pests. With wings that are razor
    sharp and eyes that can see in the dark, this fly is the stuff of nightmares.
  - To defeat the alpha fly, our froggy hero will need to use all its wits and skills.
    This is no mere fly - this is a killing machine, bred for destruction and chaos.
    But the frog is not one to back down from a challenge, and with a little help
    from some gadgets and gizmos, it's ready to take on the ultimate foe.
  - So get ready to enter a world of scientific insanity, where the alpha fly is
    the ultimate weapon of destruction. With its high-tech upgrades and killer instincts,
    it's sure to give our hero a run for its money. But with a little luck and a
    lot of guts, the frog is ready to take down this genetically modified menace
    and enjoy a well-deserved meal of alpha fly fritters.
